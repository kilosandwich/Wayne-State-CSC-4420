Implement a program to display a fileâ€™s contents. When given a single file, it
should be similar to the UNIX cat command. Name your command show. It should
have the following syntax:
$ ./show fileName
The above program displays the contents of the file named fileName.
Each system call must have error checking, and print an error message if
it occurs. You must use open(), read(), write() and close() system calls.
